# Udacity-MLEngineering

This repository contains my coursework during the [Udacity Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t). 
In this course, I learned advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms and how to package and deploy your models to a production environment. I gained practical experience using Amazon SageMaker to deploy trained models to a web application and evaluate the performance of your models. Further, I created A/B test models and learned how to update the models as I gathered more data, an important skill in industry.
